# :girl: Hi, I am Vicky

I'm a Technical Writer at [SUSE](https://www.suse.com/). Everything here is about documentation and translation.

To put what I've learned into practice and test different features, I built [my own website](https://vickyhella.github.io/).

## Working On

- Maintaining the Chinese documentation for the Rancher product line, including [Rancher](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/zh/), [Harvester](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/zh/v1.1/), [Rancher Desktop](https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/zh/), [RKE2](https://docs.rke2.io/zh/), and [K3s](https://docs.k3s.io/zh/).
- Tweaking (and writing a little bit of) scripts to automate text processing.

## Tools

- Development: Git, Markdown, Docusaurus
- Translation: OmegaT, Trados, Wordfast, Sisulizer

## Language Certificates

- BEC (Higher)
- CATTI (Level-2)
- TEM-8
- CET-6

## Learning

I am currently learning some development basics (as a beginner) to better serve the documentation:

- Python: to post-process files with scripts
- Bash: to improve efficiency with useful commands
- JavaScript: to better understand the Docusaurus framework
- GitHub Actions: to automate workflows
